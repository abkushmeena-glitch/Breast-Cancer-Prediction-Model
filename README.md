# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-Model
I have build a breast cancer prediction model using dataset - Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)).

More than 10 important features are used from dataset to predict whether the breast tumor is Malignant or Benign.
This model has accuracy of 95.32%.
This classification assists doctors and medical practitioners in making faster and more reliable decisions for early cancer detection.
